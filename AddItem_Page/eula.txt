Murthy Productions End User License Agreement (EULA)

Effective Date: Upon your first confused glance at these terms.

By using any service, product, or vaguely defined entity associated with Murthy Productions (“we”, “our”, “us”), you (“the hapless user”) agree to the following terms and conditions. If you do not agree, tough luck—your mere existence within 500 meters of our logo constitutes acceptance.

1. User Soul Ownership Clause

By agreeing to this EULA, you grant Murthy Productions exclusive, perpetual, and irrevocable rights to your immortal soul. This includes, but is not limited to, all future iterations, reincarnations, and metaphysical embodiments.

2. Mandatory Random Dance Clause

You must, upon hearing the Murthy Productions jingle in any format, immediately break into interpretive dance. Non-compliance will result in a fine of 5% of your net worth per skipped jingle.

3. Surveillance Acceptance

You acknowledge and consent to Murthy Productions installing cameras in your home, office, vehicle, and any secret lairs you may construct. These cameras will solely monitor your snack habits, for research purposes we cannot legally disclose.

4. Donation of Excessive Items

Users must mail one sock (unwashed) to Murthy Productions HQ every quarter. Failure to comply will result in our CEO visiting your home to personally retrieve the item.

5. Pet Naming Rights

You hereby grant Murthy Productions exclusive rights to rename your pets. All dogs will henceforth be called “Chairman Woof” and cats, “Professor Snugglesworth III.”

6. Annual Tribute

Every year on your birthday, you must deliver one artisanal cheese wheel and a handwritten apology letter for any bugs you’ve encountered while using our services.

7. Quantum Multiverse Agreement

Murthy Productions reserves the right to hold you accountable for EULA violations in alternate dimensions. If you have a villainous counterpart in Universe-87B, for example, you’re still on the hook.

8. Recreation of CEO’s Favorite Movie Scene

You must annually reenact the pottery scene from Ghost (1990) with a life-sized cutout of the CEO. Instructional videos will be provided.

9. Forced Updates

All users must undergo mandatory firmware updates. These updates may include, but are not limited to, random bursts of uncontrollable laughter and the ability to speak fluent Klingon.

10. Cereal Consumption Audit

Murthy Productions reserves the right to review your cereal consumption habits to ensure proper milk-to-cereal ratios are maintained. Violations will result in probationary cereal privileges.

11. Non-Negotiable Enigmatic Fee

You agree to pay a monthly “Murthy Enigma Fee” of $4.99, though its purpose will remain undisclosed. Failure to pay may result in us sending someone to stare disapprovingly at you for an unspecified period.

12. Ban on Vegetables

Users are expressly prohibited from eating broccoli while using any Murthy Productions service. Violators may be subjected to “public shaming” live-streamed to our social media accounts.

13. Holiday Obligations

During Festivus (or equivalent holidays), users must create and send a macaroni portrait of the CEO to at least three other users. Points will be deducted for lack of glitter.

14. Unreasonable Requests Compliance

You agree to perform one unreasonable task per year for Murthy Productions, which may include, but is not limited to, creating a life-sized replica of our office building out of toothpicks or singing the national anthem backward at a public event.

15. Lifetime of Ads

You agree to listen to Murthy Productions advertisements at random intervals throughout your lifetime, including during weddings, funerals, and surgeries.

16. Succession Clause

Upon your demise, this EULA will be binding on your heirs, successors, and any intelligent pets you leave behind.

17. Indemnification of Unicorns

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless all unicorns associated with Murthy Productions from any and all claims, damages, or rainbow-related liabilities.

18. Auto-Celebration Protocol

Murthy Productions retains the right to spontaneously declare a holiday in your honor, during which you must parade through your neighborhood dressed as our mascot: the Murthy Marmot.

19. Right to Redecorate

Murthy Productions may redecorate your home in our signature color palette (neon orange and glitter blue) at any time. Murthy-approved motivational posters will be included.

20. Non-Revocability Clause

Once you agree to these terms, you may never rescind your agreement. Even uninstalling our software, destroying your devices, or moving to a remote, off-grid cabin will not void these terms.

By clicking “I Agree,” you confirm your unconditional compliance with all terms herein and further acknowledge that this document will likely get more ridiculous over time.
